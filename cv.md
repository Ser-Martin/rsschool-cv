### About me
I am a person who cannot imagine life without the possibility of creating something, and it does not matter for me in what particular area - hobby or work. For the last five years I have been working as an automated control system engineer, namely designing automated control systems, writing software for PLCs and HMIs.

At the end of 2021, I began to study Front-end technologies and discovered a completely new world that embodied all the possibilities that I would like to use in my work. 

I am always ready to learn something new and develop my skills, and therefore I devote a lot of time to working on myself.

### Code example: 
**Who likes it? KATA from CODEWARS:** _You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item._
```
function likes(names) {
  switch(names.length) {
    case 0: return 'no one likes this';
    case 1: return `${names[0]} likes this`;
    case 2: return `${names[0]} and ${names[1]} like this`;
    case 3: return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names[2]} like this`;
    default: return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names.length-2} others like this`;
  }
}
```
